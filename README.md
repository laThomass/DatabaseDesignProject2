## Description
This repository houses Project 2 for Database Design. It includes a transformation of a traditional real estate database into a NoSQL format using MongoDB and Node.js, showcasing the flexibility and power of document-oriented data management.

## Installation 
To properly initialize and set up the database for viewing and querying, please refer to the "Initializing Database Instructions.pdf". This document provides a step-by-step guide to properly setting up the database and data in numerous ways, ensuring a smooth start for users.

## Acknowledgements 
Special thanks to Professor John Alexis Guerra Gomez for providing the resources necessary to complete this project. Appreciation also goes to the teaching assistants whose dedicated support has been invaluable. This project presented more challenges than anticipated, particularly with some trivial but tricky issues. Nonetheless, I am pleased with the final outcome and believe the code and database setup will be beneficial to others. Happy coding and enjoy using the database!
